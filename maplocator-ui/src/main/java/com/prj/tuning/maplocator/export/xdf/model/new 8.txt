I'm a technologist. I'm curious about everything and I love to learn. I used to manage people and business (project and IT manager) and then I moved to sales organizations.
I suppose my strenghts are perseverance, openess, ability to listen and to learn, empathy. I accept failure and I think failing can be a chance to grow more. I have good communication skills.
But I have downsides. I think I'm a poor politician. And I hate to lie. Becoming a sales person changed me a bit. But I still keep everything under control and this is a problem when you are leading large teams. I have to learn how to manage organizations without being too much invasive.
That what an executive should do, I guess. I have to learn trusting teams and capture business indicators in order to make sure that my target will be reached.
I have to learn to think globally and spend less time in the details.
I want to change my minding because I would like to move to the product management space. Of course I need  to improve my leadership and my capability to lead a business on my own. This includes finance skills, marketing and communication skills, anything that will help me to be successfull in this new role.
But I think the most important step for me right now is to starting thinking like an executive does.
